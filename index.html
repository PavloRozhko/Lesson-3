      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter One</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">Down the Rabbit Hole</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text"><span>Alice</span>, a seven-year-old girl, is feeling bored and tired while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister. She notices a talking, clothed white rabbit with a pocket watch run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled "DRINK ME," the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled "EAT ME" in currants as the chapter closes.</p>

        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Two</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">The Pool of Tears</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text">The chapter opens with <span>Alice</span> growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, <span>Alice</span> begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. After she picks up a fan that causes her to shrink back down, <span>Alice</span> swims through her own tears and meets a mouse, who is swimming as well. <span>Alice</span>, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit "Où est ma chatte?" (transl. "Where is my cat?"), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Three</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">The Caucus Race and a Long Tale</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text">The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. <span>Alice</span> and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on William the Conqueror. A dodo decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. <span>Alice</span> eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (ferocious) cat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Four</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text">White Rabbit appears again in search of the Duchess's gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his maidservant, Mary Ann, Rabbit orders <span>Alice</span> to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, Bill the Lizard, to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, <span>Alice</span> hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. <span>Alice</span> eats them, and they reduce her again in size.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Five</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">Advice from a Caterpillar</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text"><span>Alice</span> comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah. Caterpillar questions <span>Alice</span>, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by her inability to remember a poem. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells <span>Alice</span> that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, <span>Alice</span> brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Six</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">Pig and Pepper</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text">A fish-footman has an invitation for the Duchess of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. <span>Alice</span> observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes <span>Alice</span>, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning Cheshire Cat) to sneeze violently. <span>Alice</span> is given the baby by the Duchess and, to <span>Alice</span>'s surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the March Hare's house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting <span>Alice</span> to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Seven</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">A Mad Tea-Party</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text"><span>Alice</span> becomes a guest at a "mad" tea party along with the March Hare, the Hatter, and a very tired Dormouse, who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give <span>Alice</span> many riddles and stories, including the famous "why is a raven like a writing desk?." The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because Time has punished him by eternally standing still at 6 pm (tea time). <span>Alice</span> becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves, saying it is the stupidest tea party that she has ever been to.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Eight</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">The Queen's Croquet Ground</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text"><span>Alice</span> leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because The Queen of Hearts hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. <span>Alice</span> then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase "Off with his head!" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. <span>Alice</span> is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and <span>Alice</span> once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.</p>

      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Nine</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">The Mock Turtle's Story</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text">The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at <span>Alice</span>'s request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces <span>Alice</span> to the Gryphon, who takes her to the Mock Turtle. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Ten</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">Lobster Quadrille</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text">The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while <span>Alice</span> recites (rather incorrectly) "'Tis the Voice of the Lobster". The Mock Turtle sings them "Beautiful Soup" during which the Gryphon drags <span>Alice</span> away for an impending trial.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Eleven</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name">Who Stole the Tarts?</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text"><span>Alice</span> attends a trial whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including Bill the Lizard, the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the King of Hearts. During the proceedings, <span>Alice</span> finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds <span>Alice</span> and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. <span>Alice</span> scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="chapters">
        <h4 class="title chapter-number">Chapter Twelve</h4>
        <h3 class="title chapter-name"><span>Alice</span>'s Evidence</h3>
        <p class="chapter-text"><span>Alice</span> is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals to be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order <span>Alice</span> to be gone, citing Rule 42 ("All persons more than a mile high to leave the court"), but <span>Alice</span> disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say in the process, "It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place." Finally, the Queen confirms that <span>Alice</span> was the culprit responsible for stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, "Off with her head!", but <span>Alice</span> is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although <span>Alice</span> holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. <span>Alice</span>'s sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from <span>Alice</span>'s face. <span>Alice</span> leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.</p>

      <h2>Mathematics</h2>
      <p title="mathematics">Mathematics and logic are central to Alice. As Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and Through the Looking-Glass. Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine New Scientist that Dodgson wrote Alice in Wonderland in its final form as a satire of mid-19th century mathematics.</p>
